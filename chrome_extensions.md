1. Which extensions did you install? Why?

React Developer Tools – to inspect React components and see their state and props easily.
Redux DevTools – to debug Redux state and see how actions affect the app.
JSON Viewer – to read API responses in a structured and readable format.
Lighthouse – to check web app performance, accessibility, and best practices.

I installed these because they help me understand how web apps work, debug front-end issues, and analyze API data clearly. They are especially useful for testing and improving web applications.

2. What was the most useful thing you learned?

The most useful thing I learned was that React Developer Tools allows me to see the component structure and real-time state, which makes it much easier to understand how the app works. Redux DevTools also helped me track actions and see how the app state changes step by step, which is very helpful when debugging complex issues.
