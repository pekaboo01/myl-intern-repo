1. What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment?

Professional behavior means doing your work properly while being respectful and easy to work with. It means replying to messages, meeting deadlines, joining meetings on time, and taking responsibility if you make a mistake. Unprofessional behavior would be ignoring teammates, speaking rudely, blaming others, missing deadlines without saying anything, or acting negative during teamwork.

2. What does respectful communication look like in remote teams?

Respectful communication in remote work means being clear and polite in messages, since tone can easily be misunderstood in chat. It means not using harsh words, responding on time, and explaining your thoughts calmly if you disagree. It also means listening carefully and not interrupting during meetings.


When giving feedback, I should focus on what can be improved instead of attacking the person. I should be specific and helpful. When receiving feedback, I should not get defensive. I should listen first, ask questions if I don’t understand, and treat it as a way to improve myself.

4. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?

I’ve seen that teamwork works best when everyone communicates clearly and respects each other’s time. When people are honest about their progress and willing to help, things move faster and there is less confusion.

5. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?

I can make sure my messages are clear and not confusing. I can double-check my tone before sending something. I can also listen carefully in meetings and make sure everyone understands the task.

6. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

I can stay positive, be supportive, and avoid spreading negativity. I can encourage teammates, do my part well, and not create unnecessary conflict. Being friendly but still responsible helps keep the balance.

7. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

I can prepare updates ahead of time, list down questions, and review what the meeting is about. During the meeting, I can take notes and make sure I understand the next steps before it ends.

8. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

Being proactive means not waiting to be told everything. It means asking questions early, clarifying tasks, suggesting ideas if I have them, and finishing work without constant reminders.

9. How might you follow up if you need information or action from someone? When would you escalate?

I would send a polite follow-up message after some time if there’s no reply. If it starts affecting deadlines or blocking progress, I would inform my supervisor respectfully and explain that I already followed up.

10. What are some things you won’t do?

I won’t disrespect teammates, ignore messages, blame others for my mistakes, miss deadlines without communication, or act unprofessionally even if the environment is casual.
