1. Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?

The most useful shortcuts for me will be multiple cursors, Ctrl + D, and Ctrl + P. Multiple cursors will help me edit repeated lines faster. Ctrl + D makes it easy to select similar words. Ctrl + P helps me open files quickly. These will save time when working on test files and code.

2. How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?

Keyboard shortcuts save time because I don’t need to use the mouse often. They make repeated actions faster and help me stay focused. Using shortcuts keeps my workflow smooth and helps me finish tasks more quickly.
