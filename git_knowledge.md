1. Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

Yes, I have used Git before for school projects and personal coding projects. I used it to track changes in my code, manage different versions, and upload my work to GitHub. I also used it when working on group projects to collaborate with classmates.

2. Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I chose to use Git with VS Code and GitHub Desktop. I prefer VS Code because it is simple and already integrated into my coding environment. GitHub Desktop is helpful because it has a clear interface that makes commits and pushes easier to manage.

3. What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

The most interesting thing I learned is how Git tracks changes using commits and allows you to go back to previous versions of your project. I also learned how branches help developers work on features separately without affecting the main project. This makes teamwork safer and more organized.
