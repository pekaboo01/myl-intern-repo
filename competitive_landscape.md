1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

Freedom: Focuses mainly on cross-device website and app blocking, while Focus Bear combines blocking with habit tracking,  structured routines, and productivity reinforcement.
Cold Turkey: Offers very strict and hard-to-disable blocking sessions, whereas Focus Bear emphasizes flexibility alongside long-term habit development.
Tiimo: Specializes in visual scheduling and time-based planning for neurodivergent users, while Focus Bear integrates focus tools with accountability and behavior tracking.
Routinery: Concentrates on step-by-step routine building, while Focus Bear extends beyond routines by including distraction blocking and overall productivity support.

2.If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

If I were a user, I would choose Focus Bear because it provides a more complete productivity system instead of focusing on just one feature. It not only blocks distractions but also helps build consistent habits and structured routines. Having focus tools, habit tracking, and productivity support in one app would make it more convenient and reduce the need to manage multiple platforms. I would also prefer it because it supports long-term improvement rather than only short-term focus sessions.

3. What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?

Freedom: Stronger cross-device synchronization and deeper system-wide blocking controls.
Cold Turkey: Highly enforced focus sessions that are very difficult to cancel once started.
Tiimo: More advanced visual scheduling tools with rich customization and visual cues.
Routinery: Detailed step-by-step routine timers with strong automation and flow guidance.

4. Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?

Based on the comparison, Focus Bear could improve by adding an optional stricter blocking mode that makes focus sessions harder to bypass for users who need stronger discipline tools. Enhancing visual customization for routines and reminders could also make the app more adaptable and engaging for different productivity styles.
