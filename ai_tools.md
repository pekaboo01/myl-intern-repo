1. Which AI tools did you try?

I tried Cursor as my main AI coding assistant and also used Claude Opus for help with coding questions and debugging.

2. What worked well? What didn’t?

Using Cursor worked well for generating code snippets quickly and completing repetitive tasks. It helped me write code faster and saved time on small functions. Claude Opus was very helpful for explaining concepts I didn’t understand and for debugging simple problems. Sometimes, the AI suggestions were not exactly what I needed, so I still had to adjust the code manually.

3. When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

AI is most useful when I need quick code examples, debugging help, or explanations of new concepts. It’s great for repetitive tasks, learning new things, and speeding up the workflow. However, I still need to understand the code myself and check the AI suggestions carefully.
