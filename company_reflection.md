1. Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

Focus Bear was created because the founders personally struggled with ADHD and felt that existing productivity apps did not fully support neurodivergent needs. Many apps either focused only on blocking distractions or only on habit tracking, but they did not combine both in a structured and supportive way. The team wanted a solution that would actively guide users through routines, block distractions across devices, and promote sustainable focus. It was built out of lived experience and frustration with tools that were either too gentle or not designed for how ADHD brains actually work.

2. What problem is Focus Bear solving?

Focus Bear is solving the problem of distraction, inconsistent routines, and difficulty with execution that many people with ADHD and neurodivergence experience. Modern technology makes it easy to lose focus due to constant notifications, social media, and entertainment. At the same time, decision fatigue, poor sleep habits, and lack of structured routines make productivity even harder. Focus Bear addresses these issues by blocking distractions, guiding users through morning and evening routines, encouraging healthy breaks, and automatically tracking progress to maintain motivation.

3. Why do you think this mission is important?

This mission is important because ADHD and focus-related challenges affect not only academic and work performance but also mental health, relationships, and overall quality of life. With increasing technology use and rising ADHD diagnoses, more people struggle to manage attention and productivity. Providing an affordable and accessible tool that supports focus, routines, and wellbeing can make a meaningful difference. Helping people build sustainable habits and reduce burnout can positively impact both individuals and the broader community.

4. How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

Focus Bear’s work aligns with my interest in productivity, structured growth, and using technology to solve real-world problems. I value tools that are practical and evidence-based rather than just motivational. The idea of building systems that genuinely help people improve their daily lives resonates with me. As someone interested in quality assurance and software development, contributing to a product that aims to improve focus and wellbeing feels meaningful and purposeful.

5. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, I can relate to challenges such as distractions from technology, difficulty maintaining consistent routines, and sometimes feeling overwhelmed when deciding what to do next. Modern devices make it easy to lose track of time, especially when switching between tasks. Having structure, reminders, and reduced distractions can make a noticeable difference in staying focused and productive. These experiences help me better understand the value of a tool like Focus Bear.
