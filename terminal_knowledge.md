1. Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I chose Windows Terminal with PowerShell because it is fast, modern, and works well on Windows. It allows me to run commands, use Git, and manage projects in one place.

2. What customizations (if any) did you make?

I customized the theme and font to make the terminal easier to read. 

3. What was the most useful command you learned today?

The most useful command I learned is git status, because it shows which files have been changed, staged, or are ready to commit. I also found cd to navigate folders and git add . / git commit very helpful for saving my work.
