1. Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?

Vulnerable populations include people with ADHD, Autism, disabilities, mental health conditions, cognitive difficulties, and others who may struggle with executive functioning. In digital spaces, they may face challenges like information overload, confusing navigation, too many notifications, unclear instructions, sensory overload (bright colors, loud sounds), and frustration when tasks feel overwhelming.

2. What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals?

We should avoid overwhelming designs and complicated instructions. We must respect sensory needs by avoiding too much visual clutter or sudden sounds. Communication should be clear, direct, and supportive. We should not shame users for struggling. Privacy and consent are also important when handling user data.

3. How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism?

Use simple and clear language. Break tasks into small steps. Keep navigation predictable and consistent. Avoid too many choices at once. Reduce distractions. Use calm and supportive wording. Make instructions easy to follow.

4. How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting?

We can communicate clearly and avoid vague instructions. We can respect different working styles and allow flexibility when possible. We should give feedback in a direct but kind way. It also helps to set clear expectations and avoid last-minute changes when possible.

*Reflection*

1. How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

I can use simple and direct language. I can avoid sarcasm or unclear jokes in work communication. I can break down instructions into smaller steps and check for understanding. I can also be patient and avoid assuming bad intent.

2. What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

Too many notifications, cluttered screens, long paragraphs of text, unclear instructions, and sudden changes in features could make the app overwhelming. Using language that sounds judgmental or pressuring could also make users feel worse instead of supported.

3. What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

One practical change I can make is breaking instructions into short, step-by-step guidance instead of giving large blocks of information. This reduces cognitive load and makes tasks easier to follow.

*Task*

1. What did you learn from a first-person account of someone with ADHD or Autism using productivity tools?

I learned that many productivity tools feel overwhelming because they have too many features and notifications. Some users feel guilty when they fail to complete tasks, especially when apps use streaks or pressure-based systems. Clear structure and gentle encouragement work better than pressure.

2. What is one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible?

Focus Bear could include more step-by-step onboarding guidance with simple explanations and fewer features shown at once. This would reduce overwhelm for new users.

3. Write a clear, patient, and supportive response to a user struggling with executive functioning.

“Hi there. I understand that getting started can feel really overwhelming, especially when your tasks seem big or unclear. Let’s break this into one small step. What is the smallest action you can take right now? Even something simple like opening the document counts as progress. You’re not behind, and you’re not failing. We can take this one step at a time.”
