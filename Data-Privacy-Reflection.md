1. What are key takeaways from Focus Bear’s Privacy Policy?

Focus Bear collects personal data only for clear and specific purposes. The company follows GDPR and other data protection laws. Users must give consent for their data to be processed, and the company explains the legal basis for collecting data (consent, contract, legal obligation, or legitimate interest). Focus Bear protects personal data using technical and organizational security measures. Users also have rights, such as accessing, correcting, deleting, or restricting their data.

2. What types of data are considered confidential at Focus Bear?

Confidential data includes identification data (email, phone number), lifestyle and habit data, academic and professional data, marketing preferences, technical data, financial data (such as payment details handled by Stripe), profile data, and special category data like health information or religious-related habits. Company internal information, business processes, and user analytics are also confidential.

3. What are best practices for handling confidential data?

Best practices include accessing data only when necessary, not sharing sensitive information outside authorized platforms, using strong passwords and 2FA, avoiding downloading or storing sensitive data on personal devices, and following company policies. Confidential data should only be shared with approved team members or trusted service providers.

4. How should you respond to a suspected data breach or accidental disclosure?

If I suspect a data breach, I should report it immediately to my supervisor or the appropriate contact (such as privacy@focusbear.io
). I should not try to hide or fix it alone. Acting quickly helps reduce risk and ensures proper reporting under GDPR requirements.

*Reflection*

1. What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?

I can make sure I only access data I need for my work. I will avoid sharing screenshots or sensitive information in public channels. I will double-check before sending emails to ensure they go to the correct recipient.

2. How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

Sensitive information should be stored only on approved company systems. It should be shared only with authorized people using secure platforms. If data is no longer needed, it should be deleted properly according to company guidelines.

3. What are common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?

Common mistakes include sending information to the wrong email, using weak passwords, clicking phishing links, oversharing in public channels, or storing files on unsecured devices. These can be avoided by being careful, reviewing messages before sending, using strong passwords, enabling 2FA, and following security policies.

***New Habit / Security Measure**
One habit I will adopt is double-checking email recipients and attachments before sending any message that may contain sensitive information. I will also make sure all my work accounts use strong passwords and have 2FA enabled.
