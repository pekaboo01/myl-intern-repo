1. What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?

Common threats include phishing emails, fake login pages, weak passwords, public Wi-Fi attacks, malware, and data leaks. Remote workers are often targeted because they work outside secure office networks and may use personal devices.

2. What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?

Best practices include using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), keeping software updated, avoiding public Wi-Fi or using a VPN, locking devices when away, and not downloading files from unknown sources.

3. Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?

Locking your computer prevents unauthorized access. Even if you step away for a few minutes, someone could access sensitive company data. Locking your screen protects both company and user information.

4. How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?

If I receive a suspicious email or message, I should not click any links or download attachments. I should check the sender’s email carefully and report it if needed. If I am unsure, I should verify directly with the person or company through official channels.

5. What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?

A strong password is long, unique, and includes a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. It should not include personal information. A password manager helps generate and store strong passwords securely so I don’t reuse the same password across multiple accounts.

6. Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?

2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step, like a code sent to your phone. Even if someone gets my password, they cannot access my account without the second factor. I should enable 2FA on all work-related accounts and any important personal accounts.

*Reflection*

1. What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?

I already use passwords and try to avoid suspicious links. However, I can improve by making sure all my passwords are strong and unique and by enabling 2FA on every important account.

2. How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

I can make it a habit by always locking my computer when stepping away, regularly updating my passwords, and thinking carefully before clicking links. Repeating these actions daily will make them automatic.

3. What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?

I will create strong and unique passwords for each account, enable 2FA, and use a password manager to store them safely. I will also review old accounts and remove ones I no longer use.

4. What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?

I would immediately change my password, enable or reset 2FA, log out of all sessions, and report the issue to my supervisor or the appropriate team. Acting quickly can prevent further damage.

*New Cyber Security Habit*
One new cyber security habit I will follow at Focus Bear is enabling 2FA on all work-related accounts and making sure my computer automatically locks after a few minutes of inactivity.
