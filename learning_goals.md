1. What do you hope to learn from this internship?

During this internship as an Automated QA Intern, I hope to gain real-world experience in software testing and automation. I want to better understand how testing supports the development of a product and how to ensure that features work correctly before they are released to users. I also hope to learn how to write effective test cases, find bugs efficiently, and improve the overall quality of the application.

2. What skills are you most excited to develop?

I am most excited to develop my skills in automated testing, problem-solving, and attention to detail. I want to improve my ability to analyze issues, understand how systems behave, and create reliable tests that help prevent errors. I am also looking forward to strengthening my communication skills when reporting bugs and working with the team.

3. What do you think you can contribute to the team?

I believe I can contribute dedication, consistency, and a strong willingness to learn. I pay close attention to details and follow instructions carefully, which is important in quality assurance. I can help by thoroughly testing features, clearly documenting issues, and being responsible with the tasks assigned to me. I am also committed to improving continuously and supporting the team whenever needed.

4. What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?

One area I feel less confident in is handling complex test scenarios and writing more advanced automated tests. While I understand the basics, I want to become more confident in designing tests that cover different situations and edge cases. Through practice and guidance, I hope to improve my technical understanding and decision-making skills.

5. What does success in this internship look like for you?

Success in this internship means being able to contribute meaningful work, complete tasks on time, and help improve the quality of the product. It also means gaining confidence in my skills as an Automated QA intern and building a strong foundation in software testing. By the end of the internship, I want to feel proud of my growth and the value I added to the team.
